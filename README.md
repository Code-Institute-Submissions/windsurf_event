Surf Event planner - Milestone Project 3
======================================
**Surf Event Planner- Code Institute Milestone Project 3**

This [project](https://windsurf-event.herokuapp.com//) was designed and developed to be an online recipe cookbook for users. Users can browse and rate recipes listed. Users also have the option to create their own account where they can add, edit and delete their own recipes.

The project needs to be able to demonstrate the use of CRUD functions:
```
1.  Create something
2.  Read something
3.  Update something
4.  Delete a something
```

Database Schema
-----------------------------------------
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) was used to create the database for this website and it is hosted by [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

Some of the queries were easy to forsee while some evolved over the development of the site. Original plans for the database schema can be [found here](https://github.com/deevdz/milestone-project-3/blob/master/planning/Online%20Cookbook%20Project%20-%20Initial%20Thoughts.pdf).

The final database schema consists of five collections which include recipes, users, allergens, recipeCategory and skillLevel.

Final database schema diagrams can be found in the folder [Database Schema](https://github.com/deevdz/milestone-project-3/blob/master/planning/database_schema).

UX
-----------------------------------------
Documentation for the initial planning process can be [found here](https://github.com/deevdz/milestone-project-3/blob/master/planning/Online%20Cookbook%20Project%20-%20Initial%20Thoughts.pdf).

The wireframes for this site were generated using Adobe Illustrator. Wireframes for the site can be found in the folder [planning > wireframes](https://github.com/deevdz/milestone-project-3/tree/master/planning/wireframes)

After browsing through food blogs and recipe archives online the decision was made to use earthy tones. Colour Palette and final logo design can be [found here](https://github.com/deevdz/milestone-project-3/blob/master/planning/wireframes/colour-pallete-and-logo.png). I designed the logo in Adobe Photoshop.

Research was carried out on complimentary fonts and Libre Baskerville and Monsterrat were chosen for the site.

Features
-----------------------------------------
##### Existing Features

The site can be used as a guest or as a logged in user, however, some features are only available to logged in users.

Any visitor to the site can view the registered surf events at the home page.

Visitors have the option of create an account. Information required to create an account is Username (which must be unique) and password. This information is stored in the users collection. The Username are stored as plain text but the password is stored in a hashed format.

When a visitor has created an account and logged in they are given the option to register for a surf event, Edit their own registered surf event, Delete their registered surf event from the database.

Adding a new surf event is only allowed by admin users.

A user has the option to edit or delete a surf event that they have added to the site only.

Testing
-----------------------------------------
**Automated Testing:**

Using pythons built-in [Unit Test Framework](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html), automated tests were carried out on routes and forms. A testcase was created by subclassing unittest.TestCase.

The [test suite](https://github.com/deevdz/milestone-project-3/blob/master/tests/tests.py) was started with a Setup() and ended with a TearDown() in accordance with the [Ordering Test Code](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#organizing-test-code) suggested in the Unit Test Framework.

Automated tests were setup and asserted that all routes behaved as expected i.e 200 - route ok, 404 - route not found.

Tests were established to verify writing to the database and removing from the database i.e. Adding a user to the database and then removing the user and deleting a recipe from the database.

**Responsiveness Testing:**

Developer Tools, android mobile phone and android tablet were used to test the appearance of website on mobile/tablet screen size.  
   
**User Testing:**

Manual tests were carried out and the testing process was as follows:

**Homepage**
 + Click on logo or Home and verify that home page appears.
 + Click on Recipes dropdown - verify all categories are loading as options with links to the correct categories
 + If visitor is not logged in “Login” should be displayed in the navigation and clicking this link will bring you to the login page.
 + If visitor is logged in the navigation should read “Account” with dropdown links to Add recipe, My Recipes and Logout. Also should display the correct Username.
 + Search Button - click to open full screen overlay search box.
 + Ensure slider displaying correct recipes, links to recipes going to correct pages and arrows on slider working
 + “You may also be interested in” should display the four newest recipes added to the site with links to the individual recipes.

 + Try going to [http://deevdz-milestone-3.herokuapp.com/test](http://deevdz-milestone-3.herokuapp.com/test) and observe the custom 404 error.
 + Confirmed that there was a working link back to the homepage and that links in the navigation are working on the 404 error page.

**Issues Found & Fixes Implemented**
- Issue: Homepage slider area would display even if no recipe had the featured recipe switched on. Fix: Count the number of recipes that have the feature switched on if it is less than one then hide the area.
- Issue: Duplicates of the tags were displaying and the same tags were displaying each time the page loaded. Fix: Used the distinct function solve this issue and then used the shuffle function to randomise the order.
- Issue: Could not get the links to work on the materialize Homepage slider. Fix: Now using the slider provided by UIKit as it had the functionality required.
- Issue: Recipes being displayed on the wrong author page. Fix: Made the recipes group by Username rather than Author Name as username has to be unique.
- Issue: Being logged out of the session too quickly. Fix: Found a fix to the issue [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18662558/flask-login-session-times-out-too-soon)
- Issue: Adding tags through a form using Materialize chips. Fix: Found a fix here as how to bind the chips to a hidden input field [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42253115/symfony-best-practice-using-materialize-css-chips-with-symfony-forms?rq=1)
- Issue: Javascript error from the code used to bind the materialize chips to the hidden input field. Fix: Check the page to see if the class exists then execute the code otherwise ignore it. 

Deployment
-----------------------------------------
Deployment and source control was carried out via GitHub and Heroku. The repository location is as follows:[https://github.com/deevdz/milestone-project-3](https://github.com/deevdz/milestone-project-3)

Following steps were taken to deploy the website:
1. Database and Tables were created in an Atlas MongoDB account
2. Project workspace was created in Cloud 9. In this workspace: Flask was installed - `sudo pip install flask`.
3. Setup app.py file and imported flask and os - `from flask import Flask. import os`
4. Created an instance of flask - `app = flask(__name__)`
5. Tested the connection as proof of concept. `CLI - show collections` (prove connection)
6. Inside the app run() function set the host, ip and debug=true
7. Create a new Heroku App - unique name and EU Server
8. In cloud 9 login to Heroku through CLI to confirm existance of app. `CLI: heroku login. CLI: heroku apps`.
9. Create a git repository in cloud9. CLI: git init. `CLI: git add . CLI: git commit -m "Initial Commit"`
10. Connect cloud9 to Heroku. Use code found on Heroku. `CLI - $heroku git remote -a deevdz-milestone-3`
11. Create requirements.txt file - `CLI: sudo pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
12. Create Procfile - `echo web:python app.py>Procfile`
13. Add and Commit to Git Repository
14. Push to Heroku using code supplied by Heroku
15. `CLI - heroku ps:scale web=1` Command to tell Heroku to run the app
16. Login to Heroku to add config variables including IP, Port, Mongo_DB and Mongo_URI
17. Get Flask to talk to MongoDB - `CLI: sudo pip3 install flask-pymongo` `CLI: sudo pip3 install dnspython`
18. Add extra libraries to app.py - `from flask_pymongo import Pymongo` `from bson.objectid import ObjectID`
19. Add DB connection code to app.py - edit bashrc file to keep details private.
20. Test connection to DB again to confirm it's working
21. Confirm that the cloud9 runner is set to python 3
22. Connect GitHub repository to Heroku using code provided by heroku and github.
23. Set Debug to False
